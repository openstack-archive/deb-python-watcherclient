Python bindings to the OpenStack Watcher API
============================================

This is a client for OpenStack Watcher API. There's :doc:`a Python API
<api_v1>` (the :mod:`watcherclient` modules), and a :doc:`command-line script
<cli>` (installed as :program:`watcher`). Each implements the entire
OpenStack Watcher API.

You'll need credentials for an OpenStack cloud in order to use the watcher client.
